# voting-simulator
Simulation which compares different voting methods

Simulates 60,000,000 votes for 30 candidates by two different voting
methods. The first method gives exactly one vote to one candidate. The
second method gives five, four or three points to three different
candidates.
    
Both voting methods are combined. The candidate who gets the five
points also gets the single vote.
    
Results are calulated by random generator and output for both methods
for comparison of the results.
